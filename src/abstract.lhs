The X.509 standard is a widely used standard for digital certificates, which play a crucial role in secure communication and authentication. To ensure the security, reliability, and compliance of X.509 implementations, formal verification has become a necessary step in the development process. This paper presents the development of AERES, a formally verified X.509 implementation based on the interactive theorem prover Agda. We describe the development process of AERES, including the use of formal methods and interactive theorem proving to ensure that the implementation meets the specifications of the X.509 standard accurately and securely. We also describe the results of the verification process, including the elimination of security vulnerabilities and the detection of bugs and errors. We then demonstrate the utility of AERES by using it as an oracle to perform differential testing on 10 popular X.509 implementations. The results of the differential testing provide insights into the behavior of different X.509 implementations, helping to identify differences and potential problems. We conclude that AERES is a secure and reliable X.509 implementation, and that the differential testing approach provides a powerful tool for evaluating the security and reliability of X.509 implementations. This paper represents a significant contribution to the field of secure and reliable certificate management, and highlights the importance of formal verification and differential testing in the development and evaluation of X.509 implementations.
