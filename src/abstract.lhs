\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a formally verified implementation of X.509 certificate chain validation, ARMOR, based on the Agda interactive theorem prover. We prove the soundness and completeness of this implementation, using Agda's expressive type system and dependent types to provide formal guarantees of correctness against the X.509 standard specification. Furthermore, we leverage this mathematically rigorous implementation as a benchmark in a differential testing framework to analyze the behavior of 11 open-source X.509 implementations and identify noncompliance issues and potential vulnerabilities.
