\section{Conclusion}
% In this paper, we have introduced \armor, a formally-verified reference implementation for \xfon certificate chain validation. We leveraged the \agda interactive theorem prover to ensure the formal correctness of \armor, demonstrating its \soundness and \completeness properties. While \soundness ascertains that if \armor accepts a certificate chain, so does the formal specification, \completeness proves the converse. These properties underscore that \armor's behavior will always align with expectations. Serving as a reference point in a differential testing framework, \armor facilitated the discovery of noncompliance and potential vulnerabilities in $11$ open-source \xfon implementations. When tested against $2$ million real-world certificate chains, \armor correctly rejected non-compliant certificates and showed reasonable runtime and memory overhead. We are currently in the process of sharing our findings with the developers of the respective libraries.
