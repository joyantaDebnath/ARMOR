\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the design and development of a high-assurance \xfon certificate chain validation implementation, called \armor, whose compliance with standards is assured through formal, machine-checked proofs. \armor is structured into several modules corresponding to different stages of certificate chain validation, where the \agda interactive theorem prover is used to confirm the formal correctness of these modules. We compare \armor against $11$ open-source X.509 implementations for specification accuracy and overhead, identifying several noncompliance issues in them. We are currently in the process of communicating our findings to the developers of those tested implementations. We also provide an end-to-end application of \armor, integrating it with the TLS 1.3 implementation of \boringssl and testing it with the \curl data transfer tool. Our evaluation suggests that \armor is a suitable option for \xfon certificate validation in scenarios where formal correctness is prioritized over runtime overhead.
