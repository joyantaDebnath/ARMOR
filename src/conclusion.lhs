\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced ARMOR, a formally-verified reference implementation for X.509 certificate chain validation. We leveraged the Agda interactive theorem prover to ensure the formal correctness of ARMOR, demonstrating its soundness and completeness properties. While soundness ascertains that if ARMOR accepts a certificate chain, so does the formal specification, completeness proves the converse. These properties underscore that ARMOR's behavior will always align with expectations. Serving as a reference point in a differential testing framework, ARMOR facilitated the discovery of noncompliance and potential vulnerabilities in 11 open-source X.509 implementations. When tested against 2 million real-world certificate chains, ARMOR correctly rejected non-compliant certificates and showed reasonable runtime and memory overhead. We are currently in the process of sharing our findings with the developers of the respective libraries.
