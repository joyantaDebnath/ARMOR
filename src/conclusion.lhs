\section{Conclusion}
The development of AERES~\cite{debnath2021re}, a formally verified X.509 implementation, represents a significant step forward in the field of secure and reliable certificate management. The use of formal methods and interactive theorem proving in the development process ensures that AERES meets the specifications of the X.509 standard accurately and securely. The demonstration of AERES as an oracle in differential testing of 10 popular X.509 implementations highlights the utility and importance of this approach in evaluating the security and reliability of X.509 implementations. This paper underscores the need for formal verification and differential testing in the development and evaluation of critical security systems, and provides a valuable contribution to the field.
