# Lhs2TeX Template

  The text is to be written under `src/`:

    - `body.lhs` is where your text goes.
    - `definitions.lhs` is where your latex definitions and
      lhs2TeX formatting rules go.
    - `index.lhs` is the file with the conference-specific defs like 
      author, title, abstract, etc...
    - `stylish.lhs` defines the theme and snyax highlightninh.

  Bibliography goes on `references.bib`;

  The `make` command will create a folder `dist` with 
  the results in there. This is ignored by git. Moreover, `make`
  also enforces some notation as specified in `naming-convention`.
  
  New themes and styles should be added (or linked) to `tex/latex`.
